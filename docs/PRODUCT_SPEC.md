Create an implementation plan for “Intake Studio”: a Framer-like intake experience builder.

Use docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md as the single source of truth.

Constraints:
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind
- dnd-kit for drag & drop
- framer-motion for subtle animations
- zod for schema validation
- Start with localStorage persistence (no Supabase yet)

Plan must include:
1) Task breakdown into small steps (each step should touch at most 3 files)
2) File paths for each step
3) Clear acceptance criteria per step
4) Notes on tricky parts (nested drag drop, ordering, inline editing)

Output a numbered plan we can execute step-by-step.
